First, the links are separated into the different domains namely: auto, automation, bidya, csea, eict, iitg, intranet, jatinga, kamrup, kolong, local, loktak, nptel, phones, shilloi, webmail and www.iitg.

Then, the we create a word index for each of the URLs based on valid keywords using the 'PyEnchant' dictionary with the mergeIndexes.py program and then save it into json files.

Finally, we merge all the json indexes into one big json file named "merge_<num of word indices>.json"
